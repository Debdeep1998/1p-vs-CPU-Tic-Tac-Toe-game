The game has been designed and implemented using minimax algorithm,a deterministic backtracking algorithm which enables the computer to figure out the best possible moves(the game will either result in a draw or a sure victory for the bot(computer)in this case).It works based on a backtracking approach which chooses an appropriate move for the computer by probing through all possible game states at each stage of the game,or after each player input.
Improvements and Optimizations are most welcome.Thank you.
